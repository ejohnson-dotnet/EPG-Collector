EPG Collector V4.3 Fixpak 31 Release Notes
==========================================

1. Installation
===============

From the release of v4.3 fixpack 25 onward a fixpack is a complete release of the EPG Collector package. You do not need to install any base version
or earlier fixpacks before installing this release. It is released in the form of an 'msi' file. Fixpacks prior to this one were released as zip files.

The file version number for this fixpak is 4.3.7998.x except for the following

	HttpProxy.exe		1.0.7424.22476
	PSIMemoryShare		Dated 20/02/2020 9.54pm
	DVBLogicCPPPlugin.dll	Dated 13/03/2020 2.31pm Reports as version 4.3.0 in DVBLink Configuration EPG Scan tab.    
	
The file version numbers are listed in the general log when EPG Centre is loaded or can be seen by hovering the mouse over the file.

Fixpacks are cumulative. All the fixes and enhancements in previous fixpacks are incorporated into this one.

1.1 IMPORTANT NOTES
===================

1.1.1 DVBLogic Plugin Users
===========================

If you are using the DVBLogic plugin it is necessary to update the DVBLogic plugin using EPG Centre after this fixpack is 
installed.

Additional steps are needed in addition to installing the fixpack to transfer the plugin module to the location required
by TVSource. There is also an additional step if the fixpack is installed from a network drive.

EPG Centre is used to transfer the plugin module to the correct location and it is necessary to have Administrator privileges to do this 
because the TVSource EPG directory is in the Windows programs directory structure. The easiest way to ensure this is to use 
'Run as Administrator' when loading EPG Centre. This is available either by right clicking on the desktop icon or by navigating to 
the file EPG Centre.exe and right clicking on it.

The additional steps are as follows:

	1. Load EPG Centre with Administrator privileges. 

	3. Select File - Update DVBLogic Plugin.

	4. Select the path to the TVSource EPG directory.

	5. If the DVBLink server process has used the plugin previously a message will be displayed indicating that the plugin is in use.
	   The option is provided to stop and restart the DVBLink server process so that the plugin can be updated.

	5. The plugin module will be transferred to the selected directory.

	6. Repeat for any other TVSource EPG directories if there is more than one source defined in TVSource.

If additional sources are added to TVSource at a later time repeat this process for the newly created EPG directory.

If the fixpack was installed from a network drive using the Windows Extract option there is one additional step 
needed due to the Windows security system.

Navigate to the install directory and right click on the file named DVBLogicPlugin.dll and select Properties. Then click on the 
Unblock button.

As noted above, this final step is only needed if

	- the files are extracted using the Windows Extract option (not extracted using WinZip)
	- the files are extracted from a network drive

2. Fixpack 31 contents
======================

Fix	New Zealand OpenTV collections could fail if the description only consisted of the season and episode information.

Fix	Programmes that were flagged as shows that were contained in an ATSC Zap2it import file could not be recorded in WMC. 

Change	The TMDB database is now an option for TV metadata.

Change	Importing files has been changed so that if a language is specified and the category information is present but
	not in that language it will still be output.

		====================================================================================================	

3. Previous fixpacks
====================

Fixpack 30
==========

Change	TV lookups now use the TVDB API version 4.

Fix	Custom categories did not work.

Fixpack 29
==========

Fix	One of the files created during the Windows Media Center process was created in the default data directory even if the EPGC_DATA_DIR 
	environment directory was present.

Fix	Movie lookups could fail because the file BroLib32.dll was missing from the installation.

Fix	The tuning file for ATSC channel 21 was incorrect.

Fix	The Windows Media Center import process could create a negative duration for a programme which caused Windows Media Center to fail.

Fix	Part of the programme description could be duplicated when processing EIT data.

Fix	Lookups accessed both TMDB and TVDB even if they were not enabled.

Fix	The season and episode numbers for OpenTV data for Sky UK were not extracted correctly.

Fix	It was not possible to use the menu option Change Tuning Parameters to change a frequency.

Fix	Importing to DVBViewer version 7 did not work if the data came from an import file.

Change	The Files tab has been changed to add options for creating a Satellite Definition file and a Channel Definitions file.

Change	The format of the channel ID for XMLTV output now includes the channel name.

Change	Tuning for the VBox server updated to work with VBox software 2.66.27 or later. Earlier versions will still work.

Change	An option has been added to the Import tab to prevent the creation of new channels ie those not in the list of scanned channels.

Change	The UK DVB-T tuning files have been updated.


Fixpack 28
==========

This fixpack was not made officially available.

Fixpack 27
==========

Fix	The option to duplicate channel data for channels with the same name did not duplicate
	Zap2it reference numbers.

Fix	The option to duplicate channel data duplicated the data even if the destination channel had 
	it's own data.

Fix	The import to Windows Media Center could duplicate the cast and crew information every time a 
	programme was imported.

Fix 	The Create Debug Package function in EPG Centre could fail to include the Windows Media Center
	database or backup on 64 bit Windows.

Fix	The date was extracted incorrectly for UK EIT data leading to movie metadata lookup failing. In 
	addition any season and episode information was extracted incorrectly.

Fix	The category translation files were not consistent when translating movie categories for Windows
	Media Center. They now all correctly identify the category as 'Movies' which matches the usage in
	Windows Media Center itself.

Change 	Brazil-Santos DVB-T tuning file added.

Change	An option has been added to the XMLTV import parameters that allows for the 'Live' tag to annotate
	the programme description.

Fixpack 26
==========

Fix	Editing XMLTV programme categories in EPG Centre could cause an exception.

Change 	The category 'movies' has been added to the XMLTV programme categories.

Change	Movie metadata lookup will now no longer lookup data for a programme if it 
	has a series or episode number.

Change	An option has been added to EPG Centre under the 'Run - Windows Media Center Maintenance' menu 
	option to clear the programme guide.

	This can be used to reset a corrupt guide or to reorganize a Windows Media Center database.

Change	An option has been added to EPG Centre under the 'Help' menu option to create a deubug package.

	This is a convenient way to combine and compress al the files that may be needed when reporting
	faults. 

Change	Lists of channels in EPG Centre now show an indication of the sort order in the column headings.

Fixpack 25
==========

Fix	The Windows Media Center import process flagged programmes that were not series incorrectly.

Fix	If metadata lookup icons were stored using the programme title they were not imported into
	Windows Media Center.

Fix	The timezone on the Import tab was not processed correctly.
	
	This field only needs to be set if the timzeone offset is not present in the import file for
	each programme.

Fix	Continuation characters in an EIT description (...) were not always processed correctly.

Fix 	Channel logos for stations whose names contained characters that were illegal for a filename
	could not be output to an XMLTV file.

	Any illegal characters are now replaced by the '_' character.

Fix	The Windows Media Center import now correctly sets up the character played by actors which is
	visible with the cast and crew.

Fix	MHW2 collections assigned the EPG data to the wrong channels in some cases.

Fix	Metadata lookup now sets the correct category information for all types of output and includes all
	categories returned by TMDB or TVDB.

Change 	On the Import tab it is now possible to select one of 4 settings for storing images locally.

	None - no channel or programme images are downloaded,
	Channels - only channel images will be downloaded.
	Programmes - only programme images will be downloaded.
	Channels and Programmes - both channel and programme images will be downloaded. 

Change	It is now possible to import data from the Schedules Direct EPG subscription service. A description
	of the this feature can be found in the User Guide.


Change	The Windows Media Center import process now correctly processes programme updates where a generic
	description of a programme is replaced by the detailed description nearer to the time of broadcast.
	This change also improves the accuracy of series recordings.

	This change only affect Schedules Direct formatted data.

Change	Two new options have been added to the Run menu in EPG Centre. They both exist under the Windows
	Media Center Maintenance menu option.

	Remove channel logos

	This menu option will remove all channel logos from the channels in the Windows Media Center
	database.

	Remove affiliates

	This menu option will remove all affiliates from the channels in the Windows Media Center
	database.

Change	Channel lists on the Channels, Import and Schedules Direct tabs can now be excluded or included by
	selecting all the channels required using the CTRL key and, while still holding down the CTRL key,
	clicking on the Excluded checkbox.

	All the channels selected will be changed to the same setting.

Change	Metadata lookup now has an option for TV data lookup to select the priority when searching for matching
	programmes. The 2 values available are

	Series and episode numbers - this is the default value and will attempt to match on season and episode
	numbers first

	Subtitle - the subtitle will be used first when searching for a match.

	In both cases if the field(s) are not present the other field(s) will be used.

Change 	Metadata lookup will overwrite season and episode numbers broadcast if the option is set for lookup data
	to overwrite broadcast data and the matching mode is 'exact' or 'contains'.

Fixpack 24
==========

This fixpack was not made officially available.

Fixpack 23
==========

Fix	An exclamation mark in a programme title could corrupt Windows Media Center series recordings.

Fix	The Windows Media Center import file was created in the wrong directory if the environment variable to 
	relocate EPG Collector files (EPGC_DATA_DIR) was used.

Fix	Display faults with the Channel Scan feature have been corrected.

Change 	The options for Series and repeats used by the Windows Media Centre import have been changed.

	The entry labelled 'Not used' has been renamed 'Use programme title without merge' although the processing
	behind it stays the same.

	The remaining 2 options are now labelled

		Use programme title with merge
		Use broadcaster references

	Both of these options result in a different structure to the MXF import file to that previously used which
	will result in an improved experience when recording series in Windows Media Center.

	In particular, 'Use broadcaster references' used with Zap2it or Schedules Direct import files should
	produce similar results to the original data provided by Microsoft if used in conjunction with the new
	import option for setting the previously shown date to a default value (see next change).

	Changing from any one of these options to another will result in all current series recordings scheduled
	in Windows Media Center being lost and they will need to be set up again.

Change	The Import feature now has an option to set a default previously shown date. Some import files, notably
	from Zap2it, can have previously shown tags present for programmes but without a date. If this option
	is set the date in this case is set to 1st January 1970.

	It will be visible in Windows Media Center as the original air date.

	If the import file is from Zap2it and the Series and recordings option is set to 'Use programme title
	with merge' or 'Use broadcaster reference' it is advisable to set this option.

Change	It is now possible to change the timeouts used during a Channel Scan. They can be changed either before
	the scan is started or while it is running.

Change	It is now possible to transfer the results of a Channel Scan into the Selected Frequencies list on the
	Tuning tab.

	This is most relevant to ATSC broadcasts where it may not be known which frequencies carry the channels
	and hence the EPG data.

	In this case a Channel Scan can be run and the 'Load From Scan' button used to transfer all the frequencies
	that resulted in channels being located to 'Selected Frequencies' list.

Change	The tab order when creating or changing collection parameters has been altered slightly to group them in
	a more logical way. The order is now

	Tabs that define input data

		Tuning
		Input (DVBLogic parameters only)
		Import

	Tabs that define output data

		Output
		Files

	The rest of the tabs that manipulate the collected data in various ways retain the previous order.

Change	If a 'Live' tag is now present for a programme in an import file it will set the relevant indicator for
	data imported to Windows Media Center.

Change	TV Lookup no longer overwrites the programme description broadcast with any retrieved by metadata lookup. This
	option, that was introduced in a recent fixpack, now only applied to movie metadata.

	This has been change because, in the event that the wrong episode was located and used by the metadata lookup,
	the programme description could reflect the wrong episode.

Fixpack 22
==========

Fix	The Windows Media Center import could fail when creating the import file if auto channel matching was selected and 
	the match name could not be found in the Media Center database and the Channels tab had been populated. It affected all 
	types of data except DVB-S.

Change	An initial release of a channel scan feature is available from the EPG Centre Run menu.

	This is a beta level release which has been tested for DVB-S channels only. It is not a 'blind' scan but uses the
	contents of the appropriate tuning file to tune frequencies and detect channels.

	In this initial release the data is merely displayed in EPG Centre and does not update any information. It is 
	possible in future releases that it may be used to update the Windows Media Center database by adding, deleting 
	or modifying channels avoiding the necessity for manual updating.

Fixpack 21
==========

Fix	The Windows Media Center import could fail with an exception importing ATSC data if the
	match name could not be found in the Media Center database.

Fix	The Translate tab did not reload the list of channels correctly if parameters were changed.

Fix	The Windows Media Center import could leave the call sign blank if it could not be found
	in the Media Center database.

Fix	Any editing specified on the Edit tab was not applied to imported data.

Change	The Import tab has been changed to allow a custom call sign to be entered for each channel. This
	is only applicable to ATSC data that is then imported to Windows Media Center.

Change	Additional Zap2it categories have been added to the XMLTV category configuration.

Fixpack 20
==========

Fix	Using the Edit tab to replace text that occurs anywhere in a title or description with the same text
	and remove all text following resulted in an infinite program loop and collection timeout.

Fix	If a file was imported and merged with broadcast data an exception could occur.	

Fixpack 19
==========

Change	An option has been added to the Lookup tab to enable data from the online databases TMDB and TVDB to
	overwrite the broadcast data.

Change	It is now not necessary to change the mode for HDHomerun tuners to J River for a collection to get all 
	the EPG data from a broadcast. Previously it was necessary to set the tuner into 'J River' mode or only
	a subset of the EPG data would be received.

	Note however that this change does not affect EPG Centre functions Find EPG data, analyze transport stream
	and dump transport stream. If these functions are to be used with the HDHomerun tuner please read appendix
	1.4 of the User Guide for instructions.	

Fixpack 18
==========

Fix	ATSC OTA data did not import into Windows Media Center correctly.

Fix	The Windows Media Center import could create an incorrect guide if channels were merged.

Fixpack 17
==========

Fix	Setting the XMLTV option for the icon tag prefix to none did not work.

Fix	The Windows Media Centre programme guide could be corrupted with programmes linked to the wrong channels. In
	practice this could only occur with ATSC data.		

Fix	Dummy affiliates were not removed if the Windows Media Centre import name was not blank.

Fixpack 16
==========

Fix	Movie metadata lookup did not download images.This fault was introduced in fixpack 15.

Change	It is now possible to translate broadcast text to a different language. A new tab, Translate, has been
	added to EPG Centre to configure the translation. See the User Guide for full details.

Change	An option has been added to the Import options to allow the prefix 'New' to be added to the description if
	there is a New tag in the import file.

Change	An option has been added to the Output tab Windows Media Centre options to not create dummy affiliates.

	The Windows Media Centre import process creates dummy affiliates to enable channels to be uniquely identified
	when matching the channel with the EPG data manually. 

	It is useful when a broadcast stream contains multiple channels with the same name and the result is 
	that Windows Media Centre will identify the channel as, for example, Duke - EPG Collector or, if there is 
	more than one channel with the same name, TVNZ1 - Epg Collector - 1035 where the number is the channel's 
	service ID.

	If this option is set Windows Media Centre will show just the channel name. Any existing dummy affiliates
	created by EPG Collector will be removed.

Change	The option on the Lookups tab to enter a prefix to be added to the icon tag path for XMLTV ouptut has been
	moved to the Output tab XMLTV options and renamed Icon tag path prefix.

	If this field is left blank the default prefix of file:// is used. Entering the word none in this field suppresses
	the addition of any prefix.

Change	An option has been added to the Ouput tab Windows Media Centre options that enables the Media Centre tasks for
	reindexing the new data and updating the PVR schedules to be run automatically once the import has finished
	successfully.

Fixpack 15
==========

Fix	Importing data to Windows Media Center could cause it to fail with an Overflow exception if
	the data had originated from an import file where the date tag contained more than just the year.

Fix	Importing data to Windows Media Center on a 64-bit machine did not automatically link the data to the 
	channels correctly.

Change	Metadata lookup now uses a separate proxy to acess the TMDB and TVDB web sites. This is to ensure that
	lookups will still function if those sites implement TSL security rather than SSL.

Fixpack 14
==========

Fix	Any collection type that did not include programme category information in the broadcast data
	would fail if the data was imported to Windows Media Centre.

Fix	The Windows Media Centre import would fail if there was a thumbnail file in the movie or TV series
	directories that did not have a valid GUID as its filename.

Fix 	Importing ATSC channel data to Windows Media Centre did not work.


Fix	Movies were not correctly identified when importing data to Windows Media Centre if the data came
	from the metadata lookup function.

Fix	For Sky UK and Australia subtitles are now only extracted from the description if they sre present
	in the first third of the description.

	Previously the presence of the subtitle terminator semicolon anywhere in the description could result
	in corrupted subtitles and descriptions.

Change	The format of an entry on the Import tab has changed. The 'append data' option has been removed and
	incorporated into the 'Processing mode' selection. Any existing parameters will be automatically 
	transferred.

Change	An additional processing mode of 'Replace broadcast with import' has been added to the Import tab. This 
	mode will result in all the data for a channel that is received OTA being replaced by the import data.

	Note that the processing mode is irrelevant if the collection does not include any OTA data. 

Change	On the Import tab it is now possible to have images specified in an import file downloaded and stored 
	locally.

	They will be stored in the Imports directory at the same location as the movie and TV series images. On each
	run only those images that do not exist locally will be downloaded. Images will be deleted after 14 days if
	they are not referenced in the import data.

	Links to the images in both XMLTV output and the Windows Media Centre import wil point to the locally stored
	images.

Change 	The format of the channel ID on the Import tab can now be specified as Zap2it/Schedules Direct ATSC.

Fix	The programme categories imported from an XMLTV file were incorrect when output to DVBViewer.

Fix	MegaSat Sat>IP servers did not work.

Fix 	The duration for long ATSC programmes was incorrect.

Change	The original air date is now imported to Windows Media Center from TV series metadata lookup. It
	will also appear in the previously-shown tag for XMLTV output.

Change	An option has been added to the Output tab so that, in the event of no data being collected, 
	no output file is created.

Change	On the Lookups tab a threshold has been added for the matching type of nearest. Setting this parameter
	can result in less incorrect lookups.

change	For XMLTV output the location of the channel logos can now be specified.

Change 	It is now possible to specify the RTSP port on the Sat>IP config dialog.	

Change	There is a new option on the Output tab to enable part numbers to be omitted for the episode-num tag
	in XMLTV output.

Change	More formats for season and episode numbers have been added for Sky UK collections.

Change	New channels are now not automatically added if a channel scan has been done.

Change	Movie metadata lookup now looks for matches one year each side of the broadcast date in the EPG data.

Change	For XMLTV imports it is now possible to select the timezone if the file is non-standard and has no 
	UTC offsets present.

Change	The Edit tab now allows for the | (bar) character to be used in the original text and replacement
	text in place of a comma.

Change	An option has been added to the Output tab for XMLTV output to enable Plex compatible episode-num tags
	to be created.

Fixpack 11
==========

Fix	South Korean ATSC cable broadcasts could not be tuned using the HD Homerun.

Fix	Frequencies could not be tuned when the Sat>IP server was TVHeadEnd.

Fix	Spanish MHW2 collections could fail with an error code 5.

Fix	Importing of XMLTV data didn't ignore excluded channels which could result in XMLTV data being lost.

Fix	Running collections from EPG Centre under Mono did not work because of a command line error.

Fix	Huffman decoding for UK EIT data could insert invalid XML characters into the title or description causing an 
	error code 5 when the output was an XMLTV file or data was imported to WMC.

Change	DVB-T tuning files added for Poland.

Change	DVB-C tuning files have been added for Denmark.

Change	ATSC tuning files added for South Korea.

change	On the Output tab in the XMLTV options it is now possible to select as the episode tag a format that is
	compatible with the VBOX tuner/software.

Change 	It is now possible to specify a location for the data directory rahter than use the default location. It is
	specified by using the environment variable EPGC_DATA_DIR.

	Not that files are not automatically transferred from the default data directory when this variable is
	present. Any existing files must be copied manually.

Change	It is now possible to collect a specialized format of EIT data used by CanalSat and Horizon Switzerland by
	selecting the appropriate carousel profile on the Advanced dialog.

	by using a new option on the Import tab.

Fixpack 10
==========

Fix	Singapore cable season/episode numbers were not extracted correctly as the broadcaster had changed the format.

Fix	New Zealand terrestrial MHEG5 colections did not work as the broadcaster had changed the name of the directory
	holding the EPG data.

Fix	Taiwan EIT data not processed correctly.

Change	The DVBLogic channel update feature now allows for XMLTV as the EPG type for new channels.

Change	Terrestrial tuning parameters for Taiwan added.

	to the programme description.

Fixpack 8
=========

Fix	If the option to create an area/region file was selected the file contained all areas and regions even
	if an area/region had been selected.

Change	Categories can now be output to the XMLTV file with each element of the category contained within it's own
	tag.

	A new option on the Output tab XMLTV section controls this behaviour.

Change	The TV series meta data lookup now uses the region from the machine on which the collection is run to try
	and better identiy a TV series.

	For example, if the collection is run in Australia and a series title is found of 'Come Dine With Me (Australia)'
	then the details for that series will be used rather than the series entitled just 'Come Dine With Me'.

Change	Support has been added for the VBox TV server. The option needs to be enabled from the File menu in EPG Centre
	and any VBox units located will then appear as available tuners.

Change	It is now possible to specify the PID to be used in collections for the Service Description information. This is
	only needed in very limited circumstances.

Change	Arabic has been added as one of the possible input languages.

Change	If data is collected from the NileSat satellite and the country is selected as Egypt, episode numbers and the	
	production date will be extracted from the broadcast data and appear in any output.

Fixpack 7
=========

Fix	When updating DVB-S parameters in EPG Centre the parameters output could have an incorrect Satellite line.

Fix	The timeouts introduced in fixpack 6 for accessing metadata from the TMDB and TVDB internet sites was too
	short to load TV posters or thumbnails.

Fixpack 6
=========

Fix	The DVBViewer Recording Service port number was lost when parameters were updated in EPG Centre.

Fix	Sat>IP collections using the DVBViewer Recording Service could sometimes fail to tune.

Fix 	Sat>IP collections would report errors in the log when non-standard attributes were used the the 
	DVBViewer Recording Service.

Fix	New Zealand EIT collections could fail due to errors in the Huffman decompression routines.

Fix	Australian MHEG5 collections could fail with and error 5.

Fix	Huffman decompression sometimes resulted in characters being duplicated.

Change	MHEG5, EIT and FreeSat collections no longer stop if an error occurs when processing EPG entries. The
	error is logged and the collection process continues.

Change	The timeouts when accessing the internet databases for metadata lookup are now fixed at 30 seconds.

Change	THe DVB-T tuning parameters for the New Zealand Wairarapa - Popoiti transmitter have been updated.

Fixpack 5
=========

Fix	Further errors that showed up as errors in the log during lookup processing have been fixed.

Fixpack 4
=========

Fix	An out of date version the the library used to access the TVDB online database was released in fixpack 3. It
	worked correctly most of the time but would sometimes report serialization and null reference exceptions in
	the log.

	The assembly version numbers of both the TVDB library and the TMDB library are now reported in the log along
	with the version numbers of all the other dll's in the package. 

Fixpack 3
=========

Fix	A second transport stream dump would cause an exception in EPG Centre if it used Sat>IP or stream input.

Fix 	A transport stream dump using Sat>IP would fail if any pid's were specified.

Fix	The message at the end of a transport stream dump did not accurately reflect the size of the file.

Fix	The Advanced dialog parameters were all lost when DVBLogic plugin parameters were changed in EPG Centre.

Fix	NZ MHEG5 collections did not correctly extract the season and episode numbers for one of the possible formats.

Fix	Mixing NZ MHEG5 collections and OpenTV collections could cause the channel TV2 to not collect any data.

Fix 	TV series metadata lookup could set the subtitle/episode name incorrectly.

Fix	DVB-S2 tuning when using Sat>IP did not work.

Fix	NZ MHEG5 collections could fail if the season/episode numbers were in a particular format.

Fix	FreeSat collection could result in duplicate characters in the title and descriptions due to a fault in the
	Huffman decompression.

Fix	The channel update feature would display an error if the DVBLink server was already stopped when the update
	process attempted to stop it.

Change	If an XMLTV file is created it is output in channel ID sequence.

Change	The CRC checking of data received from the broadcaster has been changed to ensure that corrupted data can
	be detected more reliably.

Change	The DVB Recording Service can now be used as a Sat>IP server.

Change	Metadata lookups now create programme categories/genres in a format that is appropriate to the output medium.

Change	Movie metadata lookup now has a facility to identify specific programmes that are not to be treated as movies.

	In some cases (eg omnibus editions) a TV series could appear to be a movie by having a duration that fitted 
	into the movie parameters. If the programme happenened to also have a matching movie title on the Movie database 
	it was incorrectly identified as a movie.

Change	The interface to the TVDB database has been updated to the latest version (V2) used by the database providers.

	At some point in the near future the previous interface will be switched off by the database providers and earlier
	versions of EPG Collector that used that interface for metadata lookup will stop working.

Fixpack 2
=========

Fix	OpenTV collections would fail with an exception if the programme description was not braodcast.

Fix 	New Zealand MHEG5 collections did not correctly exclude channels if an area was selected.

Fix	On the Input tab for DVBLogic parameters the Selected Freqeuncy box could sometimes be too small so the
	scroll bar obscured the frequency.

Fix	For DVBLogic parameters the Channel scan in EPG Centre only worked for satellite receivers. For all other types
	of receiver the tuning parameters dialog reported a validation error.

Change	It is now possible on the Output tab to select more than one type of output.

	For normal collections any combination of the output methods can be chosen so that, for example, an XMLTV file can
	be created in the same run as importing to Windows Media Centre.

	For DVBLogic plugin collections an XMLTV file can be created at the same time as either importing to TVServer or
	importing to Windows Media Centre.

Fixpack 1
=========

Fix	The Windows Media Center import could fail with an exception if DVBLink was installed but not used.

Fix	Some Sky UK season/episode numbers were not extracted correctly.

Fix	FreeSat titles could be wrong if the title extended into the description and was terminated by a colon.

	file was incorrect.

Fix	If a frequency in a multi-frequency collection timed out it would cause an exception later in the run.

Fix	The DVBViewer parameters on the Output tab were lost when the parameters were loaded back into EPG
	Centre.

Fix	Loading DVBLink parameters into EPG Centre and attempting a channel scan caused an exception.

Fix	EPG Centre would display a message suggesting that the DVB-S parameters needed updating before they
	could be saved if the DiSEqC switch setting was anything other than 'None'.

Change	When matching EIT EPG data with the channels it is now possible to use just the service ID.

	Normally the network ID, transport stream ID and service ID are used to match EIT EPG data with the
	correct channel.

	However, in certain rare circumstances, only the service ID is correct in the EPG data so an extra
	option has been added to the Advanced Parameters dialog to restict the matching to service ID.

change	More explanatory log messages have been added to the DVBViewer import to aid in fault finding.

Change	Minor TV series lookup enhancements have been made to improv the hit rate when subtitles are present
	in the broadcast.
